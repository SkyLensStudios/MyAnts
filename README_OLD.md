# Hyper-Realistic Ant Farm Simulator

A scientifically accurate, single-player ant colony simulation with complex biological behaviors, realistic physics, and detailed ecosystem modeling.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Development Mode
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Build Commands
```bash
# Full production build (main + renderer)
npm run build

# Build specific processes
npm run build:main      # Electron main process
npm run build:renderer  # React renderer process

# Watch mode for development
npm run build:watch     # Both processes with hot reload
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Start Electron desktop app
npm run start:electron

# Start web development server
npm run start:web
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

1. Make sure you have Node.js 16+ installed
2. Run: `npm install`
3. Run: `npm run dev` for development
4. Run: `npm run test` for testing
5. Run: `npm run lint` for code quality

## üí° Tips

- Build tunnels to expand your colony's reach
- Workers will automatically gather nearby food
- Soldiers will defend against approaching spiders
- Save often to protect your progress!
- More ants spawn automatically when you have enough food

## üéØ Goal

Grow your ant colony into a thriving empire by managing resources, building tunnels, and defending against threats!
